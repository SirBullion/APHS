      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p><strong>All People Holistic Support</strong> We are an Aboriginal-owned and community-led provider of culturally informed NDIS, youth, and liaison services.

We proudly serve Darwin, Alice Springs, Arnhem Land, and remote communities across the Northern Territory — delivering real care through connection, community, and culture.

Our approach is grounded in deep respect for Country, culture, and the lived experiences of the people we work with. By centring Aboriginal voices and leadership, we create stronger, more responsive services that truly meet the needs of our communities.</p>
