        <h2>Why Choose Us</h2>

        <h3>Culturally Grounded & Informed</h3>
        <p>We are deeply rooted in Indigenous ways of knowing, doing, and being. Our services are built with cultural safety at the center, guided by lived experience and connection to Country.</p>

        <h3>Holistic Support That Sees the Whole Person</h3>
        <p>We go beyond just ticking boxes — we walk alongside our clients with care that supports their spirit, body, mind, and community. Our approach listens first and empowers always.</p>

        <h3>Aboriginal Owned & Community-Driven</h3>
        <p>We are led by Mob, for Mob. As an Aboriginal-owned provider, we know the real needs of our communities — and we work to bridge the gap between expectation and reality with dignity, trust, and heart.</p>
